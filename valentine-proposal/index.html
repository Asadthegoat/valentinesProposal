        <p>
          I've always been good at writing. Or at least I'd like to think so. But no matter how much I wrote, how good I got at it, I could never find the words to express how I felt about you.
          I've tried. I even made up a new word to try and describe you and how you made me feel. It was never enough, however.
        </p>

        <p>
          The kind of out of body experience which loves allows us to feel is incomprehensible unless you've felt it yourself. It's sweet, it's soft, it makes you feel like all of time has stood still, and it's the most beautiful thing in the world. It's like being wrapped in a warm blanket on a cold day, or hearing your favorite song for the first time. It's a feeling that fills you up and makes you feel whole, like you've found something you didn't even know you were missing.
          Or, specifically, someone you didn't know was missing.
        </p>

        <p>
          And then you walked into my life, and suddenly, it was all of it. 
          It was everything I didn't know I was looking for.
        </p>

        <p>
          You make me braver. You make me kinder. You make me believe in better versions of myself.
          With you, I've discovered what it means to have someone who genuinely wants 
          to see you thrive, who celebrates your wins like they're their own, 
          who stands beside you even when things get hard.
        </p>

        <p>
          So here's what I know for certain:
          <span class="highlight">I want to spend the rest of my life learning who you are. 
          I want to build a life with you that's full of gentle moments and grand adventures. 
          I want to be the person you can always count on.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          You are my home. My peace. My greatest joy.
        </p>
